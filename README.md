### Proposal Feedback
The relations between the multiple input parameters and the algorithm are somewhat unclear. How will you incorporate the buy/sell fees into the problem?

Your evaluation plan could also use a little more detail. How will you generate test data? How will you be able if the algorithm generated the correct output? By manually performing the computations? Is that approach scalable? Regarding runtime, is timeframe the only parameter that will influence performance?
